<p><b class="author">From Data to Difference</b></p>

<p>Many companies are investing in user research, but few know how to ensure that data makes a difference in the end product. Too often, data turns to dust- research reports sit on a shelf and product changing user stories fail to influence the daily decisions of the product team.</p>
<p>In this workshop, Marc and Jenna will share tools and techniques to help research 'live' in the product team and make a difference in product outcomes. In this fast-paced, activity-driven workshop, you will practice data collection, analysis and synthesis, and finally set goals for your team to integrate a realistic empathy towards users' experience into your company culture.</p>
