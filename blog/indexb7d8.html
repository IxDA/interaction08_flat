				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Thank you Autodesk!</strong><br />
We had a tremendous response. 4 vendors were vying to become our special multi-media sponsor and well, Autodesk won the race. Their generous Platinum Level contribution is just a tremendous help for us to create the kind of total experience for attendees and non-attendees in the global IxDA community. All of our corporate sponsors allow this organization to create this type of event.</p>
<p><strong>How else can you show your support?</strong><br />
On a different note, due to the fact that the conference is <a href="http://interaction08.ixda.org/blog/?p=58">sold out</a> and well we are out of room in the exhibition area, we will no longer be accepting applications for sponsorship. Such a shame as many more organizations want to show their support for IxDA and gain exposure to our attendees and global community.</p>
<p>I recommend to these organizations that many of <a href="http://ixda.org/community/local-groups/">our local communities</a> need your support and IxDA itself being member supported and not member-based relies heavily on corporate sponsorships. Talk to our Treasurer at contribute (at) ixda (dot) org for other opportunities to show your support for IxDA.</p>

After the conference, we’re planning to post recordings of the talks. Even if you are not able to attend, you will be able to replay the talks and discuss them.</p>
<p>We’d love to expand the conference, but we’re only able to take 400 people this year. That means that if you’re on the waitlist, you should assume that we won’t be able to open up a slot for you. But we mean it when we invite you to stay connected.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the sponsors we were holding out for, to sponsor our video capture and publishing endeavor fell through. We feel strongly that it is part of the IxDA mandate to make sure that our conference is available to the entire IxDA community whether they attended the conference or not. We will do these videos, but it will cost us.</p>
<p>To that end we are looking for a sponsor at the Gold or Platinum level ($7500-$12,000) that would want to support this endeavor. Instead of a booth or an event for their exposure, I believe this exposure is worth a lot more. We would put a motion graphic piece that the sponsor provides as part of the intro to every session that is played. These sessions will be up on our website long after the conference is over providing a much broader and more influential presence than a booth or simple logo on the web site.</p>
<p>If you are interested please contact David Malouf at david (at) ixda (dot) org soon, as time is running out.</p>
