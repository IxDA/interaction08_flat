				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To accommodate the sell-out crowd at Interaction08 | Savannah, a third venue has been added: Adler Hall, which is near the River Club at the Savannah College of Art and Design.</p>
<p>The River Club remains the main venue. It is the site for registration, the keynote talks, and one track throughout the day. The Sheraton hosts a second track, which is used for certain featured and lightning round presentations. Adler Hall is used for a third track of lightning round presentations.</p>
<p>There are now 15 minutes between sessions, which allows attendees more time to exchange ideas and get to the next talk. The new times are reflected in the Program section of the web site, and will soon be updated in the Connect section as well.</p>
