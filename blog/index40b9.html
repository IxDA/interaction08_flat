				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re offering two local tours during the conference. Because of limited space, registration is required. You can do so by going to RegOnline using the link provided in your confirmation email. Alternatively you can register on-site at the registration desk if space is still available.</p>
<p>#1: Tour of Historic Savannah (Friday, 4:15-6 pm)<br />
This combination bus and walking tour of the Historic District of Savannah will be given by the Architectural History department of SCAD. It will highlight the history of Savannah with a special emphasis on the historic preservation work that SCAD is doing. The tour will visit locations such as the Savannah waterfront, City Hall, Johnson Square and City Market, Monumental Savannah, and the Bull Street corridor.</p>
<p>Led by SCAD faculty members Robin Williams, Ph.D.; E.G. Daves Rossell, Ph.D.; David Gobel, Ph.D.; Karl Schuler, Ph.D.; and Jeff Eley. Please meet at the registration desk at the River Club.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px">
<p style="margin: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px">#2: Lunch tour of Savannah College of Art &amp; Design. (Saturday Sat. 12:10-1:20 pm)<br />
Instead of sitting around, take a guided tour of this special urban campus. A lunchtime tour of several SCAD buildings will include the Gulfstream Center for Furniture and Industrial Design, a former warehouse with industry-standard studio and production facilities; Hamilton Hall, which houses the film and television and sound design departments; and Montgomery Hall, a former carriage factory repurposed as high-tech studios and classrooms for animation, visual effects, interactive design and game development, and broadcast design and motion graphics departments.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px"> You will have time to pick up a box lunch and beverage at the River Club before departing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To accommodate the sell-out crowd at Interaction08 | Savannah, a third venue has been added: Adler Hall, which is near the River Club at the Savannah College of Art and Design.</p>
<p>The River Club remains the main venue. It is the site for registration, the keynote talks, and one track throughout the day. The Sheraton hosts a second track, which is used for certain featured and lightning round presentations. Adler Hall is used for a third track of lightning round presentations.</p>
<p>There are now 15 minutes between sessions, which allows attendees more time to exchange ideas and get to the next talk. The new times are reflected in the Program section of the web site, and will soon be updated in the Connect section as well.</p>
